# Changelog

## [unreleased]

### Features

- Add dedicated marker for Tiled objects (#22) and for objects layer, group layer and images layer
- Regroup tilemaps of the same tile layer using different tilesets under a common parent entity `TiledMapTileLayerForTileset`

### Bugfixes

- Prevent duplicating objects when there are multiple tilesets (#28)
- Do not rely upon `AssetEvent::added()` to actually spawn a map (#23)
  Instead, query all maps that have a `Changed<Handle<TiledMap>>` or are explictelly marked for reload.
  This allows to delay actual map spawn from asset loading (hence allowing to pre-load maps).
