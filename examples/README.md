# Examples

This directory provides a collection of examples demonstrating how to use the `bevy_ecs_tiled` crate in various scenarios.

To run an example, use the following command, replacing `XXX` with the example name:

```bash
cargo run --example XXX
```

> **Note:**  
> Some examples require one or more feature flags to be enabled.  
> If you attempt to run such an example without the required features, Cargo will display an error message with the correct command to use.

For a more in-depth explanation of crate concepts, see the [dedicated book](https://adrien-bon.github.io/bevy_ecs_tiled/).

## Keyboard Controls

Most examples support the following controls:

- **WASD**: Move the camera
- **Z/X**: Zoom out / zoom in
- **A/E**: Rotate the map (not just the camera)

> **Note for non-QWERTY layouts:**  
> Some keys may differ.  
> For example, on an AZERTY keyboard, use `A` instead of `Q` and `Z` instead of `W`.
