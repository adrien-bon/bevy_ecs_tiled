# Examples

## Keyboard controls

In most of the examples, you can use the following action keys:

- **WASD**: to move around the camera
- **Z/X**: to zoom out / zoom in
- **A/E**: to rotate the map (not only the camera)

| `infinite` | None | This example shows an infinite orthogonal map with an external tileset. |
| `infinite_embedded` | None | This example shows an infinite orthogonal map with an embedded tileset. |
| `reload` | None | This example demonstrates how to load and unload maps. |
| `finite_rapier` | `rapier_debug` | This example shows a finite orthogonal map with an external tileset and Rapier physics. |
| `infinite_rapier` | `rapier_debug` | This example shows an infinite orthogonal map with an external tileset and Rapier physics. |
| `hex_map` | None | This example cycle through all four kinds of hexagonal maps and display debug informations about Tiled objects. |

| `user_properties_rapier` | `user_properties`, `rapier_debug` | This example shows how to map custom tiles / objects properties from Tiled to Bevy Components and manually spawn Rapier colliders from them. |
| `isometric_map`| None | This example cycle through two kinds of isometric maps and display debug informations about Tiled objects. |
| `finite_avian` | `avian` | This example shows a finite orthogonal map with an external tileset and Avian2D physics. |
| `infinite_avian` | `avian` | This example shows an infinite orthogonal map with an external tileset and Avian2D physics. |
| `controller_avian` | `avian` | This example shows a simple player-controlled object using Avian2D physics. You can move the object using arrow keys. |
| `user_properties_avian` | `user_properties`, `avian` | This example shows how to map custom tiles / objects properties from Tiled to Bevy Components and manually spawn Avian colliders from them. |
| `delayed_spawn` | None | This example will delay map spawn from asset loading to demonstrate both are decoupled. |
| `multiple_tilesets` | None | This example shows a finite orthogonal map with multiple external tilesets. |
| `custom_physics` | `physics` | This example shows how to use a custom physics backend. |
