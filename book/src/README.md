**Disclaimer:**  
Both this book and the whole crate have been heavily inspired by the [`bevy_ecs_ldtk` crate](https://github.com/Trouv/bevy_ecs_ldtk), which is essentially the equivalent of `bevy_ecs_tiled` but for the [LDTK](https://ldtk.io/) map editor.  
A big thank you to the authors and contributors of `bevy_ecs_ldtk` for their inspiration and ideas!
