# Why use Tiled?

[Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) may feel a bit outdated in terms of "look and feel," especially compared to more modern map editors like [LDTK](https://ldtk.io/).  
However, [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) offers **a wealth of features** that make it a compelling choice for many projects.

If we compare [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) with [LDTK](https://ldtk.io/), both editors provide powerful capabilities such as:

- Auto-tiling
- Adding gameplay information to map tiles and objects (custom properties)
- Support for world layouts (multi-map projects)

But [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) also offers several unique advantages:

- Native support for both isometric and hexagonal maps (including "pointy-top" and "flat-top" hexes)
- Built-in support for animated tiles

For my own needs—specifically, working with hexagonal maps—[Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) was the obvious choice!

However, if you only need orthogonal maps, you might want to try [LDTK](https://ldtk.io/), especially in combination with the [`bevy_ecs_ldtk` crate](https://github.com/Trouv/bevy_ecs_ldtk).  
Of course, [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) remains a robust and versatile option for a wide range of 2D games.
