# Migration to `bevy_ecs_tiled` v0.10

This guide outlines the steps required to migrate your project to version `0.10` of `bevy_ecs_tiled`.

## Main Changes

- **Bevy v0.17 Support:**
  `bevy_ecs_tiled` now works seamlessly with Bevy v0.17, allowing you to take advantage of the latest engine features and performance improvements. See the [Bevy 0.17 release notes](https://bevy.org/news/bevy-0-17/) for details.

- **Enhanced ColliderCreated Event:**
  The `ColliderCreated` event now includes a direct reference to the collider's parent entity, making it easier to attach additional physics components or interact with spawned colliders. The event previously only contained a `TiledColliderOrigin`, which has been renamed to [`TiledColliderSource`](https://docs.rs/bevy_ecs_tiled/latest/bevy_ecs_tiled/physics/collider/enum.TiledColliderSource.html).

## Migration Steps

1. **Update Dependencies in `Cargo.toml`:**

    ```toml
    bevy = "0.17"
    bevy_ecs_tiled = "0.10"
    ```

    > **Note:** You may also need to update other Bevy-related crates to ensure compatibility.

2. **Review the [Bevy Migration Guide](https://bevy.org/learn/migration-guides/0-16-to-0-17/):**
   Follow Bevy's official migration steps to update your project for Bevy v0.17. This will help you resolve breaking changes and take advantage of new features.

3. **Update Usage of `TiledEvent<ColliderCreated>`:**

    - In previous versions, the event only provided a `TiledColliderOrigin`.
    - In v0.10, this has been renamed to [`TiledColliderSource`](https://docs.rs/bevy_ecs_tiled/latest/bevy_ecs_tiled/physics/collider/enum.TiledColliderSource.html), and the event now also includes a reference to the collider's parent entity.
    - This change makes it easier to interact with colliders and attach additional physics components directly after creation.
